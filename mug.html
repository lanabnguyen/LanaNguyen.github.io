        <p>Mug is a mobile application that incentivizes users and small business cafes to reduce single-use cup waste by rewarding them for bringing their own reusable mugs. Unlike other reusable cup apps, Mug does not require the user to purchase specific cups to use it.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
        I worked as a designer in a group project of 4 people, where we spent a semester creating an app that supports a cause that is important to us. We chose to work on sustainability and supporting local businesses, thus Mug was born.</p>


        <h3>Defining the problem</h3>
        <p>
        Users and local cafes are uninformed and unmotivated to reduce single-use cups. Single-use plastic cups contribute to climate change and material waste. In addition, local cafes lack leverage against beverage giants.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2 class="section-title">User research</h2>
        <p>Using Qualtrics surveys, we conducted user research among 60 college students who do not use reusable cups to find out how we can motivate them to do so. We found the following results:</p>
        <li>35% of students said they don’t remember to bring their cups</li>

        <li>21% said they don’t see a reason to use a reusable cup/it doesn’t bother them</li>

        <li>13% said they don’t have time</li>

        <br>

        <p>To address these concerns, we brainstormed using How Might We - to incentivize users to bring reusable cups, promote small businesses, and overall help make being sustainable more efficient in daily lives. We came up with questions such as:</p>
        <li>How might we encourage coffee drinkers to use reusable cups?</li>

        <li>How might we better advertise local coffee shops?</li>

        <li>How might we discover our target audience?</li>

        <li>How might we foster other sustainable habits?</li>


        <h3>Persona development</h3>

        <p>With the insights we received from user research, I developed the user persona to guide the design process. Generally, the most important distinctions emerge within the following categories:</p>


        <li><b>Activities:</b> Our users usually get coffee earlier in the morning to start their days, and they may usually be in a hurry in going to work or class. They can get coffee throughout the day as well.</li>
        <li><b>Attitudes:</b> Our users like convenience and efficiency especially because they have places to go. The faster the technology the better, so any way in which they can save a few minutes here or there will be very beneficial to our customers.</li>

        <li><b>Aptitude and skills:</b> Our users will be fairly familiar with forms like our app because many mobile food apps have already been created. Our app could be something similar to Starbucks, which our customers are most likely to have used before.</li>

        <li><b>Motivations:</b> The user engages with our product because it helps them save time and money which ultimately leads to less stress, especially if you have to deal with it every day. They are also engaged in our product domain for the fact that they like coffee and will easily download an app if it means they are going to get discounts at local places.</li>

        <li><b>Frustration:</b> Coffee drinkers may not like the extra steps that come with being sustainable, rather than just using a single-use cup. There also may be frustration that comes with using a new product as well.</li>

        <h3>User journey</h3>
        I also created a user journey map to identify opportunities for designing touch points with potential users. 
        <br>

        <blockquote class="big-quote">
         “How might we incentivize users to bring reusable cups, promote small businesses, and overall help make being sustainable more efficient in daily lives?”
     </blockquote>


     <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
     <p>I performed a competitive analysis to see what other brands in coffee, customer rewards, and reusability are doing and their effective or missing features.</p>

     <h3>User flows and wireframes</h3>


     <p>I then created a user flow and wireframe to capture the features that we’d like to have in the app.

     Some key features that we decided on were:</p>


     <li>Account creation and login for the user to keep track of their reusable mug usage</li>

     <li>Social aspect for users to stay connected with friends and see how much they are saving</li>

     <li>Entering card information for faster mobile ordering and receiving discounts more quickly</li>

     <li>Creating avatars for a more personal and fun experience</li>

     <li>Barcode to pay directly from mobile screen</li>

     <li>Keep the user updated on how many cups they save and recommend local coffee places</li>

     <br>

     <br>

     <h3>User feedback</h3>

     <p>Using a more interactive version of the wireframe, I was able to get more user feedback. I found that people who have less sustainable habits in their daily lives were more neutral about using the app but were still willing to try for the rewards feature. 
        <br>
        <br>
    I received some interesting feedback that I would like to incorporate:</p>



    <li>“Sendable links of the app which can give first-time customer promotions which would lead to greater app downloads and therefore more coffee sales. ” — This would further encourage the rewards feature of the app and have more people try it</li>

    <li>We initially had a card reload feature, but it might turn users away from the inconvenience of having to reload, so we would incorporate a direct payment option</li>

    <h2>Brand identity</h2>

    <p>We came up with colors, fonts, and logo for Mug and I created and finalized the design for brand identity. 
        <br>
        We chose colors that give off a friendly and calm vibe, while also fostering the ideas of sustainability with the greens. The yellow represents happiness, the red represents “look at me” for important symbols and the white and grey are there to compliment the other colors. They are also very complementary with the format of how coffee shops exude relaxation and serenity. 
        <br>
    The font Recoleta Bold serves as the headline typeface, chosen for its friendly, retro, and personable characteristics. Montserrat Alternates compliments as the subheadline and body typeface, chosen for its digital readability and soft curves.</p>

    <h2>High-fidelity prototype</h2>

    <p>We then created a high-fidelity prototype based on the brand design.</p>

The history tab shows the user where they have used the app in the past. The payment option is in the middle so that the user can find the barcode fast when needed. The cafes tab is to further discover participating cafes that the user can check out and see what rewards are available to them to encourage a visit.</p>

                <p>ECOmmunity is the social feature of Mug, where you can check out your friends’ activity on the app and see their profile history. This feature can help some users check the app more frequently, which may result in motivation to discover more local cafes and use a reusable mug to update their activity and keep themselves accountable for sustainable habits. They can also become motivated by seeing how much and where their friends are saving.</p>
